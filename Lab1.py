print ("Open the front door of Ayers Hall.")
print ("Close door. Walk up the flight of stairs to the second floor.")
print ("Once on the second floor, take a right down the hallway.")
print ("After reaching the end of the hallway, take a left.")
print ("Walk until you see room 257.")
print ("Once you see the door to 257, enter the code to unlock the door.")
print ("If successfully unlocked, open the door.")
print ("Congrats! You are in room 257 now.")
